                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> helpdesk support</p>
                    <p><strong>Experience Gained:</strong> During my 6-month tenure, I developed and refined technical
                        skills related to network troubleshooting, helpdesk support, and system administration. I played
                        a key role in addressing and resolving various network-related issues and technical problems,
                        ensuring smooth operations for users within the department. My responsibilities included
                        assisting with hardware and software troubleshooting, responding to user inquiries, and
                        providing technical guidance on solving issues related to network connectivity and system
                        performance. This experience significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and deepened my
                        understanding of IT infrastructure.</p>
